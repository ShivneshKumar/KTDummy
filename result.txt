Since the film\u2019s Japanese premiere in July, we\u2019ve already gotten hints that I Choose You! isn\u2019t the straight retelling of Ash Ketchum\u2019s origin story as we originally thought, but this new trailer makes that painfully clear.\nThe trailer starts off with some touching, memorable moments. Ash shows up late to Professor Oak\u2019s laboratory and has to start his journey with Pikachu. Pikachu and Ash butt heads until a dramatic battle bonds them forever. To really put a point on how meaningful all of this is, the mysterious, legendary Ho-Oh soars overhead.\nIt\u2019s moving stuff; good luck fighting the tears. (I had trouble.)\nBut the rest of the trailer? Not quite the familiar story we know and love from our youth. All of a sudden, Ash\u2019s journey through the Kanto region features appearances from Pok\u00e9mon native to other areas, including Entei, Incineroar and Lucario. (Not to mention that Misty and Brock are completely missing in action.) The action ramps up at the expense of our nostalgia.\nMaybe that\u2019s not a bad thing? The movie actually looks pretty action-packed, even exciting; that\u2019s not something I\u2019ve said about any Pok\u00e9mon movie since, uh, 2003. Plus, my beloved boy Charmander still gets its moment, where Ash saves it from getting drenched in the rain.\nConsider my interest piqued for Pok\u00e9mon the Movie: I Choose You!\u2019s stateside theatrical release.

The original show pales in comparison to the gorgeous imagery here, so even if nothing else, this is going to be quite the spectacle.\nNot only that, but if you're eager enough to see the film at the cinema, you'll be provided with a few free goodies.\nFor those of us lucky enough to grow up during the 90s, you may remember the limited edition promo Pok\u00e9mon trading cards that were given away to attendees of the first movie.\nI still have my beautiful promo Mewtwo card sitting safely in a ring binder. If I recall correctly, my dad cried at the iconic Ash-turned-into-stone scene. Don't tell him I told you.\nNow you can relive those childhood memories with a limited edition Ash's Pikachu promo card, emblazoned with the movie's title.\nAnyone who purchases a ticket for the November 5 and November 6 showings will receive this new card for free.\nThere's a little something extra for fans of the Pok\u00e9mon video game series too, with in-game distributions leading up to the cinema event.\nBeginning September 19, Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon players can obtain one of six versions of Ash's Pikachu wearing different versions of Ash's trainer hat.\nEach Pikachu will be released in a one-week window, ending October 30. As you can choose only one, you'll want to pick carefully.\nI personally recommend the iconic original 'green tick' hat.\nLastly, moviegovers will recieve a QR code which can be used to unlock an in-game event in the upcoming Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon video games.\nScreenings of the movie will take place nationwide on November 5 and 6.

He also meets two new characters, Sorrel and Verity, that join Ash on his journeys and seemingly replace Brock and Misty in this alternate retelling of Ash's adventures. Ash and Pikachu also make a powerful enemy out of the Mythical Pokemon Marshadow, who may have some sort of link to Ash and his shadow.\nLike the other Pokemon movies, I Choose You is an \"out of continuity\" adventure that exists outside the canon of the anime. So, fans of the series shouldn't be too concerned that Ash is running around with new companions or that many of his familiar Pokemon aren't present in the movie.\nThe movie is coming to select theaters on November 5, and will likely air on Disney XD at some point in late 2017 or early 2018.

With 20 years under its belt, the Pok\u00e9mon franchise is looking back on its beginnings. Next month, a new film will arrive in theaters and reboot the origin of Ash and Pikachu. Using the pilot of the original series, including its name, as inspiration, I Choose You! will both retell a familiar story and introduce new lore.\nThe previously-released Pok\u00e9mon the Movie: I Choose You! teaser trailer confirmed that Legendary Pok\u00e9mon Ho-Oh will factor more prominently into this retelling. Of course, not everyone made the cut. Both Brock and Misty will sit out the adventure in favor of two new human companions for Ash. The movie will also introduce some new Pok\u00e9mon that weren\u2019t featured in the earliest seasons of the original TV show. Now, with the film\u2019s debut just a month away, we have our best look yet at what to expect yet.\nRelated: 15 Times Ash Cheated to Win Pok\u00e9mon Battles\nPok\u00e9mon has released the first full-length trailer for Pok\u00e9mon the Movie: I Choose You!, and it provides us with a better understanding of how the new film will approach the mythology of Ash and Pikachu. You can watch said trailer, above!\nLike the previously-released teaser, the I Choose You! trailer repeats familiar beats like Pikachu hating Ash and them finally working together against an onslaught of Spearows. Many of these moments look to simply be reanimated and fleshed out a bit. However, the moment in which the pair see Ho-Oh in the trailer teases how the movie will add something new to this familiar origin story.\nJoined by a new team, Ash and Pikachu use the Rainbow Wing that falls from Ho-Oh to go on a new adventure seeking the Legendary Pok\u00e9mon. In the original series, the sighting of Ho-Oh was a window for Ash and audiences into the larger world of Pok\u00e9mon beyond the initial 151 creatures. Instead, I Choose You! will use the moment as the jumping off point for Ash to meet new Pok\u00e9mon, fight new trainers, and have new adventures.\nSome of these moments are teased in the trailer, as Ash and his new friends go on the search for Ho-Oh. We also see that Pok\u00e9mon outside of the Generation I will show up, including Incineroar from Sun & Moon. There\u2019s even a glimpse of a new Legendary Pok\u00e9mon, the Fighting/Ghost Marshadow. In the trailer, Marshadow is shown battling Ash and Pikachu, so it\u2019s unclear whether the creature is friend or foe to the duo. Other Legendary Pok\u00e9mon like Entei also make an appearance here, highlighting how the new film will blend various Generations together for this reimagined storyline.\nPok\u00e9mon the Movie: I Choose You! arrives in select theaters November 5, 2017.\nSource: Pok\u00e9mon\nPlay Video\nPlay\nMute\nCurrent Time 0:00\n/\nDuration Time 0:00\nLoaded: 0%\n0:00\nProgress: 0%\n0:00\nProgress: 0%\nStream TypeLIVE\nRemaining Time -0:00\nPlayback Rate\n1\nChapters\nChapters\ndescriptions off, selected\nDescriptions\nsubtitles off, selected\nSubtitles\ncaptions settings, opens captions settings dialog\ncaptions off, selected\nCaptions\nAudio Track\nshareFullscreen\nThis is a modal window.\nCaption Settings Dialog\nBeginning of dialog window.

The well-known Dark type creatures of the second-generation are Houndour, Houndoom, Sneasel, and Murkrow.\nNiantic previously promised to add three major updates to \u201cPokemon GO\u201d this year. The first major update is the addition of second-generation creatures. Assuming that the second major update is the Legendary monsters, there is a huge possibility that the third update will be the most anticipated generation-three Pokemon.\nGeneration 3 Pokemon\nWay back in August 2017, some SilphRoad data miners [VIDEO] found codes on the \u201cPokemon GO\u201d version 0.71.0 APK that contains names of the Generation 3 creatures from the Pokemon Sapphire, Emerald, and Ruby metadata. Until now Niantic remains silent regarding the developments of the third batch Pokemon.\nAccording to a report from BGR, the second-generation creatures were released eight months ago, which happens to be seven months after \u201cPokemon GO\u201d was officially launched. In other words, it is already time for Niantic to release another batch of Pokemon to the game.\nFeatures that should be added soon\n\u201cPokemon GO\u201d has a lot of things to improve. Niantic also needs to add more features to make the game easier. A player named Dinsara92 posted his suggestions to PokemonGOhub, which could help improve the game. His first suggestion is a Lucky Egg for Stardust or any item that can double the amount of stardust earned by capturing Pokemon, hatching eggs, and defending PokeGyms.\nDinsara92\u2019s second suggestion is a consumable bike or any item which will allow players to travel faster. The item could increase the speed limit of the game up to 30km/h. With this feature, players can earn candies for their buddy Pokemon even while riding a bike or driving a car at a higher speed than walking. But this feature should have an on and off option. Dinsara92\u2019s suggestions seem reasonable, and he is hoping that his ideas might reach Niantic someday. #Pok\u00e9mon GO", "publisherRegion": "Not Available", "pageURL": "http://us.blastingnews.com/gaming/2017/10/pokemon-go-halloween-event-might-bring-new-and-exciting-features-002063301.html"}], "Mu Sigma": [{"sitename": "http://www.livemint.com/", "author": "Varun Sood", "title": "Mu Sigma revenue set to top $180 million this year", "publisherCountry": "India", "date": "Fri, 15 Sep 2017 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "Bengaluru: After a complex restructuring that was necessitated by the divorce of the company\u2019s founders, Dhiraj Rajaram, back as chief executive officer (CEO) of Mu Sigma Inc., says the company is on track to expanding its revenue, which declined in 2016.\nRevenue at the data analytics start-up fell last year on account of a loss in business from clients, including some of its largest customers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Microsoft Corp., AT&T Inc. and MetLife Inc, according to company documents seen by Mint. The company reported $165 million in revenue for the year ended December 2016, down from $184 million in 2015, according to the documents.\nIn an interview, Rajaram, 42, confirmed that Mu Sigma\u2019s revenue declined last year but said the company was on track to exceeding $180 million in revenue in 2017. Mu Sigma\u2019s chief financial officer Subba Rao Telidevara said the company\u2019s revenue grew 10% in the six months ended 30 June.\nMu Sigma is trying to get past a troublesome period in which the company\u2019s business had taken a hit amid the divorce of its founders and a string of senior management departures. The blip is noticeable particularly because it came after more than a decade of expansion that drove up the company\u2019s valuation to a peak of $1.5 billion.\nLast year, co-founder and former CEO Ambiga Subramanian divorced Rajaram and stepped down as CEO in September 2016. She also sold most of her shares. The exit of Subramanian was facilitated by a complex transaction that helped Rajaram increase his ownership to 52%, ensuring he retains majority control of the company. The transaction also valued Mu Sigma at less than $900 million, though this may not be a fair estimate of the company\u2019s real worth given that it was done to get it out of a sticky situation involving its founders.\nIn May, Mu Sigma borrowed $350 million from four banks, Credit Suisse Group AG, Standard Chartered Plc., Deutsche Bank AG and Barclays Plc., to finance a complex share buyback deal. The Economic Times first reported on the loan.\nThe loan was used partly to repurchase a majority of shares held by Subramanian, who got about $170 million for selling her 20% stake back to the company, according to documents reviewed by Mint. Rajaram agreed to buy back Subramanian\u2019s remaining 4% shares at a later date, the documents show.\nCredit card firm Mastercard Inc., which had invested about $40 million in 2013 in a deal that had then valued Mu Sigma at $1.5 billion, sold its entire 2.3% stake back to the firm, according to the documents. Mastercard earned up to $18 million in the deal, taking a haircut of more than $22 million.\nTwo other investors, General Atlantic Llc and Sequoia Capital, also sold some shares back to the company. General Atlantic and Sequoia earned $90 million and $60 million, respectively, the documents show.\nRajaram, who owned about 25% share in the company, did not participate in the buyback but saw his holding increase to 52%, while General Atlantic and Sequoia, saw their ownership increase marginally, to 25% and 17%, according to documents. The remaining 6% shares are held by five individual investors or angel investors.\nThe deal valued Mu Sigma at less than $900 million. Mint couldn\u2019t ascertain the exact reasons behind the drop in valuation but it\u2019s clear that the buyback was done primarily to provide an exit to Subramanian.\nRajaram confirmed the new shareholding structure but declined to comment on the valuation. \u201cFor Mastercard, this became strategic. They had exclusivity with us for some time where we could not work with other payment companies. That exclusivity is gone. So it wasn\u2019t strategic for them anymore,\u201d he said.\nSubramanian and spokespersons at Mastercard and Sequoia did not respond to emails seeking comment. Spokespersons at General Atlantic, Wal-Mart and MetLife declined to comment.\nFounded in 2004 by Rajaram, a former Booz Allen Hamilton Inc. consultant, Mu Sigma has a workforce of more than 3,000 employees who help clients make sense of data to help them run their businesses better. Rajaram\u2019s ambitious vision and ability to hire smart leaders helped the Illinois-based company quickly become India\u2019s largest software product start-up.\nHe did it using very little cash. Rajaram said Mu Sigma has so far raised less than $10 million of primary capital from investors; the rest of the investor capital\u2014more than $200 million\u2014has simply gone from one investor to another, he said. Mu Sigma is also one of the very few profitable Indian start-ups. In an ecosystem where start-ups keep requiring fresh doses of capital just to keep their businesses running, its healthy profit margin is enviable.\nIndeed, until the turbulence of the past 18 months, the capital efficiency, consistently strong sales growth and ever-expanding profits made it seem like Mu Sigma was unstoppable.\nApart from the decline in revenue last year, Mu Sigma has also been hit by the departure of six senior executives since March. Last month, Deepinder S Dhingra, head of products and design, put in his papers. Dhingra, who joined the company in 2009, five years after Mu Sigma was founded, was one of Rajaram\u2019s trusted lieutenants. In July, Shelly Singh, head of sales, and Mike Feldner, who managed the company\u2019s business in the Midwest and South-East regions of US, resigned. In June, Mukund Raghunath, a senior vice- president who oversaw the company\u2019s largest client, Wal-Mart Stores, and was also the company\u2019s first employee in the US, put in his papers. In May, Ketan Awalegaonkar, executive vice-president, resigned. Senior departures include Nat Iyer, global head, strategic hiring.\nRajaram dismissed any suggestion of employees losing confidence in his leadership and said the company had no plans of hiring an external CEO.\n\u201cAre people losing faith in me? One thing you have to look into is that all these people have been around for 7-8 years, and all these years I have been CEO. So if they did not have faith, they would have left a long time back. That is not the issue,\u201d Rajaram said.\n\u201cEverybody is important\u2026 They have contributed very well to this company. And we respect them. And we want to celebrate their success going forward. All these people (who have quit) have got better opportunities\u2026 But the company is very resilient,\u201d he added.\nFirst Published: Fri, Sep 15 2017. 01 42 AM IST", "publisherRegion": "Southern Asia", "pageURL": "http://www.livemint.com/Companies/WduopE6GzUpOB4LrhdWLeM/Mu-Sigma-revenue-set-to-top-180-million-this-year.html"}, {"sitename": "GlobalCapital", "author": "Shruti Chaturvedi", "title": "Mu Sigma bags three commitments in general", "publisherCountry": "United Kingdom", "date": "Fri, 08 Sep 2017 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "General syndication for Indian data analytics firm Mu Sigma\u2019s debut loan is in its last leg, with three banks having committed so far.\nThe $394m loan opened for retail participants about two months ago, after a senior phase during which the four original mandated lead arrangers and bookrunners \u2014 Barclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and Standard Chartered \u2014 brought in Bank of Baroda also as an MLAB, ANZ, BNP Paribas, IndusInd Bank, ...\nTo discuss GlobalCapital access for your entire department or company please contact our subscriptions sales team at: subs@globalcapital.com or find out more online here.", "publisherRegion": "Northern Europe", "pageURL": "http://www.globalcapital.com/article/b14nc8ghyx08cp/mu-sigma-bags-three-commitments-in-general"}, {"sitename": "Scroll.in", "author": "Manu Balachandran", "title": "The first woman to head an Indian unicorn is now the country\u2019s youngest self-made woman millionaire", "publisherCountry": "India", "date": "Thu, 28 Sep 2017 00:00:00 GMT", "text": "The first woman to head an Indian unicorn \u2013 a startup valued at over $1 billion \u2013 has added another impressive title to her name.\nAmbiga Subramanian, former CEO of data analytics firm Mu Sigma, is the youngest of India\u2019s eight richest self-made women, according to the Hurun India rich list 2017, published on September 26 by Shanghai research firm Hurun Report.\nWith a net worth of over Rs 2,500 crore, Subramanian ranked fourth after Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, chairperson of biotechnology company Biocon, Vembu Radha, director at software products maker Zoho, and Sheela Gautam, chairperson emeritus of mattress-maker Sheela Foam.\nThe Hurun India rich list ranks Indians with wealth in excess of Rs 1,000 crore.\nLast year, 42-year-old Subramanian sold her 24% stake in Illinois-based Mu Sigma to her former husband Dhiraj Rajaram, the company\u2019s founder and chairman, following their divorce. Rajaram then went on to buy stock options held by his employees to finally emerge as the controlling shareholder of the firm he established in 2004. Mu Sigma is estimated to have a valuation of $1.5 billion.\nSubramanian and Rajaram first met in the early 1990s at the College of Engineering, Guindy, in Chennai, where they were both studying electrical engineering. The two later went on to study computer engineering at Wayne State University in Michigan.\nSubramanian, ranked among India\u2019s most powerful businesswomen by Forbes last year, began her career in 1998 with the American telecom major Motorola, where she worked for eight years. Rajaram worked with consultancies such as Booz Allen Hamilton and PwC before striking out on his own with Mu Sigma, which he funded by selling their home in Illinois and putting in $200,000 of his personal savings. Subramanian joined him in 2007.\n\u201cWhen Dhiraj started Mu Sigma, I did not join him because we had a year-old baby and we didn\u2019t want to keep all our eggs in one basket. So I had a more stable job at that time. But after a few years, Dhiraj had struck a big deal and he and his colleague were talking about it when they suggested that I join them to manage the new client. My first engagement with Mu Sigma was to take care of one of the client engagements out of Chicago.\u201d\nAccording to her LinkedIn profile, Subramanian started off as director for innovation in 2007, going on to become the company\u2019s head of talent management in 2010. In 2012, she took over as the chief operating officer, which she remained till January 2016, after which she became CEO. Subramanian is yet to respond to a questionnaire from Quartz.\nMu Sigma grew rapidly on the back of a model that delivered big-data analytics to multinational corporations from centres in India. Today, it employs over 4,000 workers and serves 140 of the Fortune 500 companies.\nIn 2012, it crossed the $100 million revenue mark and went on to became India\u2019s first profitable unicorn. For financial year 2015-16, Mu Sigma posted a profit of Rs 462.9 crore (paywall), a 22% increase from the year before. It has raised over $211 million so far in seven rounds of funding, backed by investors such as Sequoia, General Atlantic, and Mastercard. It counts American companies such as Walmart, Microsoft, and Dell among its clients.\nHowever, 2016 didn\u2019t go quite well.\nLast year, the company faced some serious turmoil when Subramanian and Rajaram decided to get divorced, and senior executives began quitting amidst talk of a power struggle between the couple. In March, Goutham Ekollu, the head of operations who had been with the company for a long time, left. He was followed by Sayandeb Banerjee, head of delivery, in August, and several mid-level delivery managers.\nThe resulting chaos led to loss of business. In the year ended December 2016, Mu Sigma\u2019s revenues fell to $165 million, from $184 million in 2015.\nThe turmoil was finally put to rest when Rajaram bought out Subramanian\u2019s stake.\n\u201cWe have built a great company over the last 11 years,\u201d Subramanian said in a statement at the time. \u201cDue to personal circumstances, it is time for me to move on from the management team of the company and do something different. All rumours about me starting a competitive firm are untrue. While there is a lot of interest in the market to invest into a promising and profitable company like Mu Sigma, I have agreed to support Dhiraj\u2019s interest to purchase my shares and get a controlling stake that will allow him to fulfill his vision.\u201d\nSince her exit, Subramanian has largely stayed out of public eye. Mu Sigma, meanwhile is back on track and is looking at revenues in excess of $180 million in 2017.\nWe welcome your comments at letters@scroll.in.", "publisherRegion": "India", "pageURL": "https://scroll.in/article/852094/the-first-woman-to-head-an-indian-unicorn-is-now-the-countrys-youngest-self-made-woman-millionaire"}], "Disney": [{"sitename": "mirror", "author": "Mirror.co.uk", "title": "Pandora UK launch magical Disney charm collection - and shoppers get a FREE gift with any purchase over \u00a399", "publisherCountry": "United Kingdom", "date": "Thu, 05 Oct 2017 10:06:00 GMT", "text": "Today Pandora UK launched their highly anticipated Disney range.\nThe collection features charms of all your favourite characters including Mickey and Minnie Mouse and there's even Cinderella's slipper.\nThe hand-crafted in sterling silver charms can be added to an existing bracelet.

To expand on that discussion, here is why I don't own Walt Disney (DIS) and have no plans to change that in the near term.\nFirst off, a semantic issue. Many commenters rejected Dividend Sensei's use of the term \"fire sale\" to describe Disney stock, since it is down less than 15% from its 52-week high. It runs contrary to the general usage of the term - for example, the definition from Investopedia:\nA fire sale consists of selling goods or assets at heavily discounted prices. Fire sale originally referred to the discount sale of goods that were damaged by fire; it may now refer to any sale where the seller is in financial distress. In the context of the financial markets, fire sale refers to securities that are trading well below their intrinsic value, such as during prolonged bear markets.\nDisney hasn't been through any existential trauma - the headwinds at ESPN are a setback but hardly company-threatening. And the market as a whole has shown little distress or tendency toward prolonged bearishness recently.\nThat said, Dividend Sensei uses a different definition of the term. Here's his definition of fire sale:\nRegardless of semantics, the underlying claim is what counts. If Disney is trading at a 25%+ discount to its fair value - particularly given stretched valuation multiples elsewhere, it'd be high time to consider taking a sizable position in DIS stock.\nDisney: It Simply Isn't On Sale\nUnfortunately, I don't see a strong case for suggesting Disney is undervalued at all, let alone to a substantial degree, and thus I'm not buying Disney stock at anywhere near current levels.\nI will grant one of the bull case's main points though. Concerns about ESPN are overblown. Yes, the company seemingly blundered by politicizing the channel - people often watch sports to distract themselves from real-world stress, reminding them of political headaches while relaxing is probably not an ideal branding strategy.\nMore generally, the tide is flowing out against cable channels, but this threat is well-known and in fact has been talked about to death. You can't pin a bear thesis on something that is already known by virtually all market participants.\nThat said, even granting the assumption that ESPN will be fixed (or spun off), I still don't see much value in Disney's stock above $100/share. My colleague, J Mintzmyer of Value Investor's Edge, nailed the bearish case on Disney two years ago. He foresaw the problems in ESPN back when the market was still oblivious, writing at the time:\nESPN-fueled growth (of the total cable business) accounted for 60% of the profit growth over the past decade and now accounts for a total of 56% of the total profits. When you buy DIS today, you aren't buying the House of Mouse with a 'side' of sports anymore - you are now buying the King of Monopolized Sports who also has a Mouse [...]\nESPN makes the lion's share of its profits from (unsustainable) subscription revenues, at nearly double the rate of its advertising profit. The first cracks of ESPN's strength are beginning to emerge, and I expect this trend to be a long-term drag on profit growth. Note, I'm not predicting disaster at ESPN, I still think it's a great brand, but let's be honest about the source of growth and its future potential. When you're buying the most expensive blue chip on the market, you need that growth.\nSince Mintzmyer's prescient call, here is how Disney (blue line) has performed against the S&P 500:\nDisney is down 12% over the past two years, while the market has rallied more than 20%. And on a total return basis, Disney fares worse yet, considering the below-average dividend yield.\nAt this point, you may be asking, but Ian, since Disney has underperformed dramatically since 2015, isn't now the time to get long? And to answer it, no it's not. There's another key piece to Mintzmyer's thesis - and this one, unlike ESPN's problems - isn't widely understood yet.\nThe other problem is earnings quality. Everyone loves to look at PE ratios, but some earnings are of higher quality than others. In Disney's case, between 2010 and 2014, free cash flow tended to make up just 55-75% of actual earnings. That's in large part because Disney has to expend so much capital on its parks. The parks aren't a bad business, but they do require enormous sums of capital to build and maintain. When a company consistently has to spend much of its earnings on capex, you should ding the valuation you assign the stock a bit. FCF generation has been healthier the past couple years, but it's unclear if this is a permanent improvement or just a low ebb in the park spending cycle.\nWe can see the cash flow versus earnings difference reflected in Gurufocus' estimates of Disney's stock value based on various metrics. Disney is overvalued by all its possible metrics, but it scores most attractively on an earnings-based DCF model:\nThe earnings-based model assigns Disney stock a value of $99, just shy of today's price. Free cash flow-based DCF, on the other hand, comes up with an $81 target, given Disney's inability to consistently turn all of its earnings into cash. This isn't a fault of Disney in particular - it's something inherent to their business model.\nBut bulls on the stock should be aware of this. Dividend Sensei's $140+ price target, based on a DCF model, seems aggressively high. Using the same stated parameters that he did ($5.40 starting value, 9% discount rate) while leaving everything else at default settings in Gurufocus, you get this, assuming 6.9% growth going forward:\nYou'll note that is some rather substantial downside from today's price - 17% in fact. What accounts for the difference between $83 and $140, based on 6.9% growth, then? Presumably, you could increase the terminal growth rate and years of terminal growth significantly. But these are imperfect assumptions as it is very hard to see the future more than 10 years out. I shy away from using DCF models as a core of my investing analysis, since they are subject to confirmation bias - you can get the model to spit out a favorable result by adjusting parameters that are largely unknowable (such as the future growth rate starting in the year 2027).\nAnd even 7% growth going forward requires a bit of faith - I'd hardly call that a \"conservative case\" given, as Mintzmyer noted above, that ESPN made up more than half of profit growth for Disney back to 2005. Thus, you should severely ratchet down future expectations for growth from the firm, as its strongest source of historical profit growth is now an outright drag on earnings. With that in mind, 17x earnings (and more than that times cash flow) seems quite expensive - or at minimum fully-priced. And there's more...\nRecession Risk\nI know, I'll get scorn for this. The market only goes up anymore, and there's no sign of a recession on the horizon either. But even the global central banking community's actions haven't eliminated the business cycle. We will get another downturn. Be it next year or five years from now, it's coming. And when it does, Disney will suffer.\nDisney is very exposed to the economy. It doesn't really have a recession-resistant portion of its portfolio. The theme parks and consumer products require strong consumer spending. The TV business suffers if advertising spend slows. And while movie spend might be somewhat recession-resistant, the industry appears to be in secular decline.\nI conceded that the market may be overly concerned about ESPN's current struggles. In particular, the political noise can be largely ignored. However, the long-term value of content is falling, as value is transferring to those who own the consumer-facing platform (such as Spotify and Netflix) rather than the content creator. I built on this idea in \"Disney Leaves Netflix: A Big Mistake.\"\nLast time the economy tanked, Disney took a long time to get back to growth. In fact, EPS topped in 2007 at $2.34, and wouldn't exceed that level until 2011. I know there's no sign of a recession yet, but the next one is coming sooner or later, and you'll likely see years of outright earnings declines at Disney when it does, particularly with ESPN having flipped from the core growth asset to EPS liability. Suddenly that 17x earnings ratio doesn't seem like much of a margin of safety at all for a cyclical company at the tail end of an unusually long economic expansion.\nI'm not super-bearish on Disney stock - I'm not suggesting this is a short candidate or anything. But the stock is fully valued (if not overvalued) and it wouldn't shock me in the least if shares traded down 10 or 20% in the coming year at any sign or market or economic weakness. To get serious upside on the stock, the problems with ESPN need to resolve themselves, Disney's streaming service needs to succeed, and you need continued good economic fortune in coming years.
